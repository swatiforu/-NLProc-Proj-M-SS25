# Legal Assistant System: GDPR Document Analysis and Question Answering

## Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent legal assistant system designed to analyze and answer questions about GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) documents. The system combines document retrieval, semantic search, and large language model generation to provide accurate, context-aware legal responses with specific article and section references.

## System Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with three main components:

### 1. Document Retriever (`retriever.py`)
- **Purpose**: Processes PDF documents and creates searchable embeddings
- **Key Features**:
  - PDF text extraction using PyMuPDF
  - Intelligent document chunking based on legal structure patterns
  - Semantic embedding generation using SentenceTransformers
  - FAISS-based vector similarity search

### 2. Response Generator (`generator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Generates contextual legal responses using the Gemma-3-1B model
- **Key Features**:
  - Streaming text generation for real-time output
  - Custom stopping criteria to control response length
  - Structured prompting for legal accuracy
  - Automatic article/section reference inclusion

### 3. Legal Assistant Coordinator (`legal_assistant.py`)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates model loading and component integration
- **Key Features**:
  - GPU/CPU device detection and optimization
  - Model loading with memory-efficient configurations
  - Pipeline setup for text generation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Document Processing Pipeline

#### Text Extraction and Chunking
```python
def smart_chunk(self, text, min_size=300):
    # Identifies legal document structure patterns:
    # - Article numbers (ARTICLE 1, ARTICLE 2, etc.)
    # - Section numbers (SECTION 1.1, SECTION 2.3, etc.)
    # - Paragraph markers (ยง1, ยง2, etc.)
    # - Subsection markers ((a), (b), etc.)
    # - Headers (all caps text)
```

The chunking algorithm preserves legal document structure by:
- Maintaining minimum chunk size (300 characters) for context
- Respecting natural document boundaries
- Preserving hierarchical relationships

#### Semantic Search Implementation
- **Embedding Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dimensional embeddings)
- **Index Type**: FAISS IndexFlatL2 for exact L2 distance search
- **Search Parameters**: 
  - Top-k retrieval (default: 3 chunks)
  - Similarity threshold (default: 0.5)
  - Fallback handling for low-relevance queries

### Language Model Integration

#### Model Specifications
- **Model**: Gemma-3-1B-Instruct (1.9GB)
- **Architecture**: 26-layer transformer with sliding window attention
- **Context Window**: 32,768 tokens
- **Precision**: Float16 for GPU, Float32 for CPU
- **Memory Optimization**: Low CPU memory usage, automatic device mapping

#### Generation Parameters
```python
# Optimized for legal text generation
max_new_tokens=512
temperature=0.1          # Low temperature for consistent output
top_p=0.95              # Nucleus sampling
